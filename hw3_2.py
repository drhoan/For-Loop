# Write a program that uses a for loop to print "One of the months of the year is January"
# "One of the months of the year is February" "One of the months of the year is March" etc …. 
# Hint you will need to create a list of months before you loop.
# To create a list, use: months = ["January","February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]

    for month in months:
